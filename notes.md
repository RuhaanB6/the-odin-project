# Functional Requirements and Notes for the building process

## Light/Dark Mode toggle
  - HTML Markup (Form controls)
  - Switching between the 2 on the website
  - CSS Variables and Classes (Custom properties of visual stuff)
  - "prefers-color-scheme": seems important
    - Three option toggle (light, dark, system) ^^

## Learning Goals
  - HTML and CSS for visual
  - JS to be able to make a website functional
  - Be able to replicate this to a personal website

## Links
  - https://codepen.io/rustcode/pen/YPPbxYX (This is for my own website -- an art style)

## Things to remember
  - RESEARCH, A LOT. Find ways to do things that you want to do.
