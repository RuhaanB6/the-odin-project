# The Odin Project follow through

This is basically my "doodle page" equivalent for learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the purpose of WebDev through `The Odin Project`. It will contain code snippets borrowed from tutorials and then tinkered with, and with a readme to assist me in the future aswell.

It will also contain sample projects make over the course of me following the tutorial, and can be used as reference if you're also going through a similar journey
